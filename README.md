Network of Digital Material Bank features and characteristics
Creators: Piotrowski, Piotr

This record provides an interactive HTML bundle (HTML plus local JS/CSS assets) that visualises how features and characteristics interrelate in BIM-enabled Digital Material Banks (BIM-DMBs). It was produced for the article “BIM-enabled material reuse: Needs and barriers from a Swiss–Liechtenstein perspective” in Phase0 Journal.

The visualisation maps relationships across six themes:

Building data
Product data
Stakeholder responsibilities
Operational characteristics
Technical features
Connected services
Open the HTML file in any modern browser to explore nodes and links interactively.
